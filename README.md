Overview
This therapeutic gaming solution is specifically designed for adults, focusing on improving reaction time and cognitive function. Players navigate through a realistic supermarket environment, collecting products while the game measures and tracks their response times.
## Game Features

### Difficulty Levels
- Easy (Speed: 0.2) - Perfect for beginners and initial assessment
- Medium (Speed: 0.3) - Balanced challenge for regular practice
- Hard (Speed: 0.4) - Advanced level for improved capabilities

### Game Modes
1. Two-Lane Mode
   - Basic mode with simplified navigation
   - No obstacles
   - Perfect for initial therapy sessions
   - Focus on lateral movement and timing

2. Three-Lane Mode
   - Intermediate difficulty
   - No obstacles
   - Enhanced spatial awareness challenge
   - Greater range of lateral movement

3. Three-Lane Mode with Obstacles
   - Advanced therapeutic challenge
   - Dynamic obstacle placement
   - Combines cognitive processing with physical response
   - Enhanced coordination requirements

### Performance Metrics
The game tracks:
- Average reaction time (in seconds)
- Missed products count
- Speed level performance
- Obstacle interaction performance
- Session date and progress tracking
